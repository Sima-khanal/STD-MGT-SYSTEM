            <h1>Welcome to the Student Management System</h1>
            <p>The Student Management System (SMS) facilitates the efficient management of students, teachers, and courses, streamlining administrative tasks and enhancing communication. By enabling admins to add teachers and teachers to register students, the system creates a structured environment where roles are clearly defined. Admins have full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) access, ensuring comprehensive oversight, while teachers can manage student data and monitor attendance and grades. Students benefit by having access to their own academic information, fostering accountability and engagement in their educational journey. Overall, SMS promotes an organized approach to education management, improving efficiency and user experience.</p>
